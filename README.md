# shipitdudemouse &mdash; If you must ship it, ship it good.

[shipitdudemouse](https://github.com/cmeiklejohn/shipitdudemouse) is a simple way to remind yourself of what's important in life.  Managing your attention is critical in this Internet age, and shipitdudemouse is the *only* way to make sure you stay focused enough to ship it like a true dudemouse.

## Why ship it?

Ancient Celtic soothsayers often spoke of a great ship that would come, bearing Patrick Ewing.  That ship has come and gone, and now it is time for you to make your own damn ship.  Like Noah.  Yeah, I probably should have riffed on Noah instead.

## What is a dudemouse?

It's a fucking dudemouse.
